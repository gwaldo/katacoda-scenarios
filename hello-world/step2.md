# Exploring our services 

A brief tour of the application:
a single-page frontend in React
4 micro-services in Python or Node
In the React app, a Dashboard component calls the “/status” route  of the frontend-api which makes calls to multiple services, including the “pumps” service which we’ll focus on, and returns a summary of all data to be displayed
Users can also add pumps 
The code can be edited live


Go to pumps-service, take a look at the metrics that are being submitted
