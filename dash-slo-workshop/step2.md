# Exploring our services and user journeys 

Letâ€™s take a quick tour of our application. 

You can tour the application by examining the content of the docker-compose.yml file. This application was originally developed for a Distributed Tracing workshop to showcase how Datadog APM integrates with multiple programming languages and technologies. 

Today we'll focus on 3 containers:
 
* The agent: it is necessary to collect metrics and traces from the other containers
* Frontend: a Python Flask application that receives calls and routes them to different backend services, the code lives in the ./frontend folder. It also serves a React Single Page Application as a static file built from the ./single-page-frontend folder.
* Pumps: another Flask application that receives calls from the frontend related to the water pumps. Its code lives in the ./pumps-api folder

Both Flask applications are automatically instrumented by Datadog APM (see the `command` statements in docker-compose.yaml) which will generate metrics in the `trace.flask.` namespace.

This Katacoda environment allows you to modify the Python code and see the results. Simply browse the code in the editor and edit it then type Ctrl+C in the terminal to quit Docker Compose and start it again with the `docker-compose up` command.


So let's think about reliability of this system. To start tracking SLIs we'll consider what our user journey should be. Go to the water pump web app and explore! https://2886795280-5000-ollie01.environments.katacoda.com/

One of the main functions on this page is the ability to add a new water pump. Can you add one?
