# Ensuring Reliability with SLOs 

Welcome! We'll be running a docker-compose command, allowing us to spin up an entire environment.

About the workshop
 
Uptime is a poor measure of reliability. Agile development’s fail-fast approach coupled with distributed applications and dynamic infrastructure requires us to have a better understanding of reliability.

Service level objectives (SLOs) help you understand the true health of your systems and how your end users experience them. Poorly defined SLOs means you have little to no visibility into the successes and failures of those apps and their services. In this workshop you’ll learn how to define SLOs and monitor the right service level indicators to ensure reliability. Armed with this information, we'll introduce chaos into a sample application and learn how to respond effectively using error budgets.
